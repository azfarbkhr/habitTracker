# Habit Tracker
## Project Description
This is a habit tracking app that allows users to track their habits. It allows users to create habits, track their progress against a target, and view their progress over time.

## Development Constriants
This is a minimal viable product (MVP), so there are no design considerations, and the focus is on functionality. The code is organized into a Django project called habit_tracker and an app called habits.
